It was recklessly driving. It was overtaking left and right. It was a white Maruti Suzuki Swift. I couldn't see the number plate correctly but it was not number plate of Mangalore because its registration was KA20. I could see there were two people inside the car. One was a woman, one was a man. Both looked about the same age of 22 to 23. When right across the intersection, the car steered right into the pavement and hit the scooters. It was a loud crash. About 15 of the scooters fell down and it was a very big incident. I saw a sticker of Udupi Institute of Technology on the rear shield. Please try to save them. Please try to bring them to justice."}
